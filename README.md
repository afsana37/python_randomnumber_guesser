# Number Guesser Game

## Overview
Number Guesser is a simple yet fun GUI-based game built with Python's Tkinter module. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a set number of attempts and time limit. This game tests your guessing ability and provides hints to help you zero in on the correct number.

## Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Each game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- **Attempt Limit**: You have 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
- **Time Limit**: Each game session has a 30-second time limit.
- **Dynamic Hints**: Provides hints whether your guess is too high, too low, or very close.
- **Game Over Dialogs**: Informative pop-up messages when you guess the number or run out of attempts or time.

## Installation
To run this game, you will need Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `tkinter` for the GUI
- `random` for generating random numbers
- `time` for handling the time limit

All these libraries come pre-installed with Python, so no additional installation is required.

## Running the Game
To start the game, navigate to the directory containing the game file and run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
